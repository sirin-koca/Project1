# Python Fundamentals 🐍

* Data Types: Python has various data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans.
* Variables: Variables are used to store data values. The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.
* Operators: Python supports the usual mathematical operators such as +, -, *, /, and %.
* Control Flow: Python uses indentation to define control flow, instead of curly braces or keywords.
* Functions: Functions are used to organize code and to perform specific tasks. The def keyword is used to define a function.
* Modules: Python has a large standard library that includes modules for various tasks. Additional modules can be imported using the import keyword.

### Examples

```
# variable assignment
x = 5
name = "Sirin"

# arithmetic operations
y = 2
print(x + y)  # 7
print(x - y)  # 3

# conditional statement
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is negative")

# function definition
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# function call
result = add(x, y)
print(result)  # 7

# import statement
import math
print(math.pi)  # 3.141592653589793
