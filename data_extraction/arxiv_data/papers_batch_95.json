        "abstract": "  Simulation has long been an essential part of testing autonomous driving\nsystems, but only recently has simulation been useful for building and training\nself-driving vehicles. Vehicle behavioural models are necessary to simulate the\ninteractions between robot cars. This paper proposed a new method to formalize\nthe lane-changing model in urban driving scenarios. We define human incentives\nfrom different perspectives, speed incentive, route change incentive, comfort\nincentive and courtesy incentive etc. We applied a decision-theoretical tool,\ncalled Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to take these incentive policies\ninto account. The strategy of combination is according to different driving\nstyle which varies for each driving. Thus a lane-changing decision selection\nalgorithm is proposed. Not only our method allows for varying the motivation of\nlane-changing from the purely egoistic desire to a more courtesy concern, but\nalso they can mimic drivers' state, inattentive or concentrate, which\ninfluences their driving Behaviour. We define some cost functions and calibrate\nthe parameters with different scenarios of traffic data. Distinguishing driving\nstyles are used to aggregate decision-makers' assessments about various\ncriteria weightings to obtain the action drivers desire most. Our result\ndemonstrates the proposed method can produce varied lane-changing behaviour.\nUnlike other lane-changing models based on artificial intelligence methods, our\nmodel has more flexible controllability.\n",

Biomimicry of shepherding offers computational methods\nfor swarm control with the potential to generalize and scale in different\nenvironments. However, learning to shepherd is complex due to the large search\nspace that a machine learner is faced with. We present a deep hierarchical\nreinforcement learning approach for shepherding, whereby an unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) learns to act as an aerial sheepdog to control and guide a swarm\nof unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The approach extends our previous work on\nmachine education to decompose the search space into a hierarchically organized\ncurriculum.

The theoretical insights are used to design a robust,\nreal-time rebalancing algorithm, which is applied to a case study of New York\nCity. The case study shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met\nwith about 8,000 robotic vehicles (roughly 60% of the size of the current taxi\nfleet). Finally, we extend our queueing-theoretical setup to include congestion\neffects, and we study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on\noverall congestion.

Due to the sensing of its surroundings and information exchanged\nwith other vehicles and road infrastructure, a CAV will have access to large\namounts of useful data. While different control algorithms have been proposed\nfor CAVs, the benefits brought about by connectedness of autonomous vehicles to\nother vehicles and to the infrastructure, and its implications on policy\nlearning has not been investigated in literature. This paper investigates a\ndata driven driving policy learning framework through an agent-based modelling\napproaches. The contributions of the paper are two-fold. A dynamic programming\nframework is proposed for in-vehicle policy learning with and without\nconnectivity to neighboring vehicles. The simulation results indicate that\nwhile a CAV can learn to make autonomous decisions, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)\ncommunication of information improves this capability. Furthermore, to overcome\nthe limitations of sensing in a CAV, the paper proposes a novel concept for\ninfrastructure-led policy learning and communication with autonomous vehicles.\nIn infrastructure-led policy learning, road-side infrastructure senses and\ncaptures successful vehicle maneuvers and learns an optimal policy from those\ntemporal sequences, and when a vehicle approaches the road-side unit, the\npolicy is communicated to the CAV. Deep-imitation learning methodology is\nproposed to develop such an infrastructure-led policy learning framework.\n",

Then, we design the optimal\ndispatch policy of which nodes to visit at what time and by what agent by\nfinding a policy set that maximizes a utility that is defined as the total\nreward collected at visit times. We show that this optimization problem is\nNP-hard and its computational complexity increases exponentially with the\nnumber of the agents and the length of the mission horizon. By showing that the\nutility function is a monotone increasing and submodular set function of\nagents' policy, we proceed to propose a suboptimal dispatch policy design with\na known optimality gap. To reduce the time complexity of constructing the\nfeasible search set and also to induce robustness to changes in the operational\nfactors, we perform our suboptimal policy design in a receding horizon fashion.\nThen, to compensate for the shortsightedness of the receding horizon approach\nfor reward distribution beyond the feasible policies of the agents over the\nreceding horizon, we add a new term to our utility, which provides a measure of\nnodal importance beyond the receding horizon's sight.

Customer requests (jobs) occur according to a spatio-temporal\nstochastic process not known by the system. If job selection uses a policy in\nwhich the first job (FJ) is served first, the system may collapse to\ninstability by removing just one vehicle. Policies that serve the nearest job\n(NJ) first show such threshold behavior only in some settings and can be\nimplemented in a distributed manner. The timing of job selection has\nsignificant impact on delivery time and stability for NJ while it has no impact\nfor FJ. Based on these findings we introduce a methodological approach for\ndecision-making support to set up and operate such a system, taking into\naccount the trade-off between monetary cost and service quality. In particular,\nwe compute a lower bound for the infrastructure expenditure required to achieve\na certain expected delivery time.

        "abstract": "  UAV swarms have triggered wide concern due to their potential application\nvalues in recent years. While there are studies proposed in terms of the\narchitecture design for UAV swarms, two main challenges still exist: (1)\nScalability, supporting a large scale of vehicles; (2) Versatility, integrating\ndiversified missions. To this end, a multi-layered and distributed architecture\nfor mission oriented miniature fixed-wing UAV swarms is presented in this\npaper. The proposed architecture is built on the concept of modularity. It\ndivides the overall system to five layers: low-level control, high-level\ncontrol, coordination, communication and human interaction layers, and many\nmodules that can be viewed as black boxes with interfaces of inputs and\noutputs. In this way, not only the complexity of developing a large system can\nbe reduced, but also the versatility of supporting diversified missions can be\nensured. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is fully distributed that each\nUAV performs the decision-making procedure autonomously so as to achieve better\nscalability. Moreover, different kinds of aerial platforms can be feasibly\nextended by using the control allocation matrices and the integrated hardware\nbox. A prototype swarm system based on the proposed architecture is built and\nthe proposed architecture is evaluated through field experiments with a scale\nof 21 fixed-wing UAVs. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, this paper\nis the first work which successfully demonstrates formation flight, target\nrecognition and tracking missions within an integrated architecture for\nfixed-wing UAV swarms through field experiments.\n",

The problem of covering a given environment using multiple robots\ncan be naturally formulated and studied as a multi-Traveling Salesperson\nProblem (mTSP). In a mTSP, the environment is represented as a graph and the\ngoal is to find tours (starting and ending at the same depot) for the robots in\norder to visit all the vertices with minimum global cost, namely the length of\nthe longest tour. The mTSP is an NP-hard problem for which several\napproximation algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms usually assume\ngeneric environments, but tighter approximation bounds can be reached focusing\non specific environments. In this paper, we address the case of environments\ncomposed of sub-parts, called modules, that can be reached from each other only\nthrough some linking structures. Examples are multi-floor buildings, in which\nthe modules are the floors and the linking structures are the staircases or the\nelevators, and floors of large hotels or hospitals, in which the modules are\nthe rooms and the linking structures are the corridors. We focus on linear\nmodular environments, with the modules organized sequentially, presenting an\nefficient (with polynomial worst-case time complexity) algorithm that finds a\nsolution for the mTSP whose cost is within a bounded distance from the cost of\nthe optimal solution. The main idea of our algorithm is to allocate disjoint\n\"blocks\" of adjacent modules to the robots, in such a way that each module is\ncovered by only one robot. We experimentally compare our algorithm against some\nstate-of-the-art algorithms for solving mTSPs in generic environments and show\nthat it is able to provide solutions with lower makespan and spending a\ncomputing time several orders of magnitude shorter.\n",

The results show that our approach for solving the optimization\nproblem associated with motion planning gives solutions within seconds in cases\nwhere general purpose solvers fail due to high complexity. In addition, our\nlightweight assignment strategy leads to successful and quicker formation\nconvergence in 96-100% of all trials, whereas indefinite gridlocks occur\nwithout it for 33-50% of trials.

Real-time\ncollision avoidance with other dynamic obstacles or agents is done by\nperforming outer polyhedral representations of every interval of the\ntrajectories and then including the plane that separates each pair of polyhedra\nas a decision variable in the optimization problem. MADER uses our recently\ndeveloped MINVO basis to obtain outer polyhedral representations with volumes\n2.36 and 254.9 times, respectively, smaller than the Bernstein or B-Spline\nbases used extensively in the planning literature. Our decentralized and\nasynchronous algorithm guarantees safety with respect to other agents by\nincluding their committed trajectories as constraints in the optimization and\nthen executing a collision check-recheck scheme. Finally, extensive simulations\nin challenging cluttered environments show up to a 33.9% reduction in the\nflight time, and a 88.8% reduction in the number of stops compared to the\nBernstein and B-Spline bases, shorter flight distances than centralized\napproaches, and shorter total times on average than synchronous decentralized\napproaches.\n",

Even though coupled path planning approaches provide\noptimal collision-free paths for each agent of the MRS, they search the\ncomposite space of all the agents and therefore, suffer from exponential\nincrease in computation with the number of robots. On the other hand,\nprioritized approaches provide a practical solution to applications with large\nnumber of robots, especially when path computation time and collision avoidance\ntake precedence over guaranteed globally optimal solution. While most\ncentrally-planned algorithms use static prioritization, a dynamic\nprioritization algorithm, PD*, is proposed that employs a novel metric, called\nfreedom index, to decide the priority order of the robots at each time step.\nThis allows the PD* algorithm to simultaneously plan the next step for all\nrobots while ensuring collision-free operation in obstacle ridden environments.\nExtensive simulations were performed to test and compare the performance of the\nproposed PD* scheme with other state-of-the-art algorithms.

However, many widely-used\nmethods based on model predictive control (MPC) lack theoretical guarantees on\nthe feasibility of underlying optimization. Furthermore, when applied in a\ndistributed manner without a central coordinator, deadlocks often occur where\nseveral robots block each other indefinitely. Whereas heuristic methods such as\nintroducing random perturbations exist, no profound analyses are given to\nvalidate these measures. Towards this end, we propose a systematic method\ncalled infinite-horizon model predictive control with deadlock resolution. The\nMPC is formulated as a convex optimization over the proposed modified buffered\nVoronoi with warning band. Based on this formulation, the condition of\ndeadlocks is formally analyzed and proven to be analogous to a force\nequilibrium. A detection-resolution scheme is proposed, which can effectively\ndetect deadlocks online before they even happen. Once detected, it utilizes an\nadaptive resolution scheme to resolve deadlocks, under which no stable\ndeadlocks can exist under minor conditions. In addition, the proposed planning\nalgorithm ensures recursive feasibility of the underlying optimization at each\ntime step under both input and model constraints, is concurrent for all robots\nand requires only local communication.

For this methodology, the\ndisturbance, noise, and model uncertainty are considered; and a velocity\nobstacle method is utilized to formulate the collision-avoidance constraints in\nthe velocity space. With the exploitation of geometric information of static\nobstacles and velocity obstacles, a distributed optimization problem with\nprobabilistic chance constraints is formulated for the stochastic multi-agent\nsystem. Consequently, collision-free trajectories are generated under a\nprescribed collision risk bound. Due to the existence of probabilistic and\ndisjunctive constraints, the distributed chance-constrained optimization\nproblem is reformulated as a mixed-integer program by introducing the binary\nvariable to improve computational efficiency. This approach thus renders it\npossible to execute the motion planning task in the velocity space instead of\nthe position space, which leads to smoother collision-free trajectories for\nmulti-agent systems and higher computational efficiency. Moreover, the risk of\npotential collisions is bounded with this robust motion planning methodology.\nTo validate the effectiveness of the methodology, different scenarios for\nmultiple agents are investigated, and the simulation results clearly show that\nthe proposed approach can generate high-quality trajectories under a predefined\ncollision risk bound and avoid potential collisions effectively in the velocity\nspace.\n",

Specific contributions include exact and fast approximation\nmethods for calculating the probability of a set of independent normally\ndistributed random events occurring in a given order, a method for calculating\nthe most likely and n-th most likely orders of occurrence for a set of\nindependent normally distributed random events that have equal standard\ndeviations, and a method for approximating the conditional probability\ndistributions of the events given a specific order of the events. The complete\nframework is shown to be faster than a Monte Carlo approach for the same\naccuracy in two multi-robot task allocation problems. In addition, the\nimportance of incorporating uncertainty is demonstrated through a comparison\nwith a deterministic method. This is a general framework that is agnostic to\nthe optimisation method and objective function used, and is applicable to a\nwide range of problems.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a model for controlling swarms of mobile agents via broadcast\ncontrol, assumed to be detected by a random set of agents in the swarm. The\nagents that detect the control signal become ad-hoc leaders of the swarm. The\nagents are assumed to be velocity controlled, identical, anonymous, memory-less\nunits with limited capabilities of sensing their neighborhood. Each agent is\nprogrammed to behave according to a linear local gathering process, based on\nthe relative position of all its neighbors. The detected exogenous control,\nwhich is a desired velocity vector, is added by the leaders to the local\ngathering control. The graph induced by the agents adjacency is referred to as\nthe visibility graph. We show that for piece-wise constant system parameters\nand a connected visibility graph, the swarm asymptotically aligns in each\ntime-interval on a line in the direction of the exogenous control signal, and\nall the agents move with identical speed. These results hold for two models of\npairwise influence in the gathering process, uniform and scaled. The impact of\nthe influence model is mostly evident when the visibility graph is incomplete.\nThese results are conditioned by the preservation of the connectedness of the\nvisibility graph. In the second part of the report we analyze sufficient\nconditions for preserving the connectedness of the visibility graph. We show\nthat if the visibility graph is complete then certain bounds on the control\nsignal suffice to preserve the completeness of the graph. However, when the\ngraph is incomplete, general conditions, independent of the leaders topology,\ncould not be found.\n",

        "abstract": "  Individual robots are not effective at exploring large unmapped areas. An\nalternate approach is to use a swarm of simple robots that work together,\nrather than a single highly capable robot. The central-place foraging algorithm\n(CPFA) is effective for coordinating robot swarm search and collection tasks.\nRobots start at a centrally placed location (nest), explore potential targets\nin the area without global localization or central control, and return the\ntargets to the nest. The scalability of the CPFA is limited because large\nnumbers of robots produce more inter-robot collisions and large search areas\nresult in substantial travel costs. We address these problems with the\nmultiple-place foraging algorithm (MPFA), which uses multiple nests distributed\nthroughout the search area. Robots start from a randomly assigned home nest but\nreturn to the closest nest with found targets. We simulate the foraging\nbehavior of robot swarms in the robot simulator ARGoS and employ a genetic\nalgorithm to discover different optimized foraging strategies as swarm sizes\nand the number of targets are scaled up. In our experiments, the MPFA always\nproduces higher foraging rates, fewer collisions, and lower travel and search\ntime compared to the CPFA for the partially clustered targets distribution. The\nmain contribution of this paper is that we systematically quantify the\nadvantages of the MPFA (reduced travel time and collisions), the potential\ndisadvantages (less communication among robots), and the ability of a genetic\nalgorithm to tune MPFA parameters to mitigate search inefficiency due to less\ncommunication.\n",

Our aim is\nto produce optimal assignments, such that the average waiting time at\ndestinations is minimized. Since noisy travel time estimates result in\nsub-optimal assignments, we propose a method that offers resilience to\nuncertainty by making use of redundant robots. However, solving the redundant\nassignment problem optimally is strongly NP-hard. Hence, we exploit structural\nproperties of our mathematical problem formulation to propose a\npolynomial-time, near-optimal solution. We demonstrate that our problem can be\nreduced to minimizing a supermodular cost function subject to a matroid\nconstraint. This allows us to develop a greedy algorithm, for which we derive\nsub-optimality bounds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with\nsimulations on transport networks, where uncertain edge costs and uncertain\nnode positions lead to noisy travel time estimates. Comparisons to benchmark\nalgorithms show that our method performs near-optimally and significantly\nbetter than non-redundant assignment.

Based on the human-robot minimum distance and\ntheir relative velocities, a controller output characterized by a modulating\nrobot operation speed is obtained. To avert self-avoidance, a self occlusion\ndetection method is implemented using ray-casting technique to filter out the\ndistance values associated with the robot-self and the restricted robot\nworkspace. For validation, the robot workspace is monitored using a motion\ncapture setup to create a digital twin of the human and robot.

The vehicles are each assumed to be equipped with a forward-facing\nmonocular camera, and to be capable of communicating with each other. This\ncollaborative localization approach is developed as a decentralized algorithm\nand built in a distributed fashion where individual and relative pose\nestimation techniques are combined for the group to localize against\nsurrounding environments. The MAVs initially detect and match salient features\nbetween each other to create a sparse reconstruction of the observed\nenvironment, which acts as a global map. Once a map is available, each MAV\nperforms feature detection and tracking with a robust outlier rejection process\nto estimate its own pose in 6 degrees of freedom. Occasionally, one or more\nMAVs can be tasked to compute poses for another MAV through relative\nmeasurements, which is achieved by exploiting multiple view geometry concepts.\nThese relative measurements are then fused with individual measurements in a\nconsistent fashion. We present the results of the algorithm on image data from\nMAV flights both in simulation and real life, and discuss the advantages of\ncollaborative localization in improving pose estimation accuracy.\n",

        "abstract": "  Swarm robotic search is concerned with searching targets in unknown\nenvironments (e.g., for search and rescue or hazard localization), using a\nlarge number of collaborating simple mobile robots. In such applications,\ndecentralized swarm systems are touted for their task/coverage scalability,\ntime efficiency, and fault tolerance. To guide the behavior of such swarm\nsystems, two broad classes of approaches are available, namely nature-inspired\nswarm heuristics and multi-robotic search methods. However, simultaneously\noffering computationally-efficient scalability and fundamental insights into\nthe exhibited behavior (instead of a black-box behavior model), remains\nchallenging under either of these two class of approaches. In this paper, we\ndevelop an important extension of the batch Bayesian search method for\napplication to embodied swarm systems, searching in a physical 2D space. Key\ncontributions lie in: 1) designing an acquisition function that not only\nbalances exploration and exploitation across the swarm, but also allows\nmodeling knowledge extraction over trajectories; and 2) developing its\ndistributed implementation to allow asynchronous task inference and path\nplanning by the swarm robots. The resulting collective informative path\nplanning approach is tested on target search case studies of varying\ncomplexity, where the target produces a spatially varying (measurable) signal.\nSignificantly superior performance, in terms of mission completion efficiency,\nis observed compared to exhaustive search and random walk baselines, along with\nfavorable performance scalability with increasing swarm size.\n",

The long-range\ncommunication helps drones identify next subarea to be targeted based on\nweighted RNN (Reverse nearest neighbor).

Many multi-robot on-line coverage path planning algorithms have\nbeen developed as extensions of well established off-line coverage algorithms.\nIn this work we introduce a novel approach to multi-robot on-line coverage path\nplanning based on a method borrowed from game theory and machine learning-\nMonte Carlo Tree Search. We implement a Monte Carlo Tree Search planner and\ncompare completion times against a Boustrophedon-based on-line multi-robot\nplanner. The MCTS planner is shown to perform on par with the conventional\nBoustrophedon algorithm in simulations varying the number of robots and the\ndensity of obstacles in the map. The versatility of the MCTS planner is\ndemonstrated by incorporating secondary objectives such as turn minimization\nwhile performing the same coverage task. The versatility of the MCTS planner\nsuggests it is well suited to many multi-objective tasks that arise in mobile\nrobotics.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper presents an approach for deploying and maintaining a fleet of\nhomogeneous fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for all-time coverage of\nan area. Two approaches for loiter circle packing have been presented: square\nand hexagon packing, and the benefits of hexagon packing for minimizing the\nnumber of deployed UAVs have been shown. Based on the number of UAVs available\nand the desired loitering altitude, the proposed algorithm solves an\noptimization problem to calculate the centres of the loitering circles and the\nloitering radius for that altitude. The algorithm also incorporates fault\nrecovery capacity in case of simultaneous multiple UAV failures. These failures\ncould form clusters of survivor (active) UAVs over the area with no overall\nsurvivor information. The algorithm deploys a super-agent with a larger\ncommunication capacity at a higher altitude to recover from the failure. The\nsuper-agent collects the information of survivors, and updates the homogeneous\nradius and the locations of the loitering circles at the same altitude to\nrestore the full coverage. The individual survivor UAVs are then informed and\ntransit to the new loitering circles using Dubin's paths. The relationship with\nthe extent of recoverable loss fractions of the deployed UAVs have been\nanalysed for varying the initial loiter radii. Simulation results have been\npresented to demonstrate the applicability of the approach and compare the two\npresented packing approaches.\n",

        "abstract": "  Typical Multi-agent Path Finding (MAPF) solvers assume that agents move\nsynchronously, thus neglecting the reality gap in timing assumptions, e.g.,\ndelays caused by an imperfect execution of asynchronous moves. So far, two\npolicies enforce a robust execution of MAPF plans taken as input: either by\nforcing agents to synchronize or by executing plans while preserving temporal\ndependencies. This paper proposes an alternative approach, called\ntime-independent planning, which is both online and distributed. We represent\nreality as a transition system that changes configurations according to atomic\nactions of agents, and use it to generate a time-independent schedule.\nEmpirical results in a simulated environment with stochastic delays of agents'\nmoves support the validity of our proposal.\n",

From the theoretical analysis, we prove that the\nneeds-driven cooperation in a heterogeneous robot system enables higher group\nutility than a homogeneous robot system.

        "abstract": "  For a multi-robot system equipped with heterogeneous capabilities, this paper\npresents a mechanism to allocate robots to tasks in a resilient manner when\nanomalous environmental conditions such as weather events or adversarial\nattacks affect the performance of robots within the tasks. Our primary\nobjective is to ensure that each task is assigned the requisite level of\nresources, measured as the aggregated capabilities of the robots allocated to\nthe task. By keeping track of task performance deviations under external\nperturbations, our framework quantifies the extent to which robot capabilities\n(e.g., visual sensing or aerial mobility) are affected by environmental\nconditions. This enables an optimization-based framework to flexibly reallocate\nrobots to tasks based on the most degraded capabilities within each task. In\nthe face of resource limitations and adverse environmental conditions, our\nalgorithm minimally relaxes the resource constraints corresponding to some\ntasks, thus exhibiting a graceful degradation of performance. Simulated\nexperiments in a multi-robot coverage and target tracking scenario demonstrate\nthe efficacy of the proposed approach.\n",

        "abstract": "  The key concept for safe and efficient traffic management for Unmanned\nAircraft Systems (UAS) is the notion of operation volume (OV). An OV is a\n4-dimensional block of airspace and time, which can express an aircraft's\nintent, and can be used for planning, de-confliction, and traffic management.\nWhile there are several high-level simulators for UAS Traffic Management (UTM),\nwe are lacking a framework for creating, manipulating, and reasoning about OVs\nfor heterogeneous air vehicles. In this paper, we address this and present\nSkyTrakx -- a software toolkit for simulation and verification of UTM scenarios\nbased on OVs. First, we illustrate a use case of SkyTrakx by presenting a\nspecific air traffic coordination protocol. This protocol communicates OVs\nbetween participating aircraft and an airspace manager for traffic routing. We\nshow how existing formal verification tools, Dafny and Dione, can assist in\nautomatically checking key properties of the protocol. Second, we show how the\nOVs can be computed for heterogeneous air vehicles like quadcopters and\nfixed-wing aircraft using another verification technique, namely reachability\nanalysis. Finally, we show that SkyTrakx can be used to simulate complex\nscenarios involving heterogeneous vehicles, for testing and performance\nevaluation in terms of workload and response delays analysis. Our experiments\ndelineate the trade-off between performance and workload across different\nstrategies for generating OVs.\n",

The robots, capable of only local communication,\nexplore a bounded environment according to a random walk modeled by a\ndiscrete-time discrete-state (DTDS) Markov chain and exchange information with\nneighboring robots, resulting in a time-varying communication network topology.\nThe proposed strategy is proved to achieve consensus, here defined as agreement\non the presence of a static target, with no assumptions on the connectivity of\nthe communication network. Using numerical simulations, we investigate the\neffect of the robot population size, domain size, and information uncertainty\non the consensus time statistics under this scheme. We also validate our\ntheoretical results with 3D physics-based simulations in Gazebo. The\nsimulations demonstrate that all robots achieve consensus in finite time with\nthe proposed search strategy over a range of robot densities in the\nenvironment.\n",
