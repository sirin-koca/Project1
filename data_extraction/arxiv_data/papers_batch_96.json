        "title": "CL-MAPF: Multi-Agent Path Finding for Car-Like Robots with Kinematic and\n  Spatiotemporal Constraints",
        "abstract": "  Multi-Agent Path Finding has been widely studied in the past few years due to\nits broad application in the field of robotics and AI. However, previous\nsolvers rely on several simplifying assumptions. They limit their applicability\nin numerous real-world domains that adopt nonholonomic car-like agents rather\nthan holonomic ones. In this paper, we give a mathematical formalization of\nMulti-Agent Path Finding for Car-Like robots (CL-MAPF) problem. For the first\ntime, we propose a novel hierarchical search-based solver called Car-like\nConflict-Based Search to address this problem. It applies a body conflict tree\nto address collisions considering shapes of the agents. We introduce a new\nalgorithm called Spatiotemporal Hybrid-State A* as the single-agent path\nplanner to generate path satisfying both kinematic and spatiotemporal\nconstraints. We also present a sequential planning version of our method for\nthe sake of efficiency. We compare our method with two baseline algorithms on a\ndedicated benchmark containing 3000 instances and validate it in real-world\nscenarios. The experiment results give clear evidence that our algorithm scales\nwell to a large number of agents and is able to produce solutions that can be\ndirectly applied to car-like robots in the real world.

        "abstract": "  Multi-agent path finding in formation has many potential real-world\napplications like mobile warehouse robots. However, previous multi-agent path\nfinding (MAPF) methods hardly take formation into consideration. Furthermore,\nthey are usually centralized planners and require the whole state of the\nenvironment. Other decentralized partially observable approaches to MAPF are\nreinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, these RL methods encounter\ndifficulties when learning path finding and formation problem at the same time.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel decentralized partially observable RL\nalgorithm that uses a hierarchical structure to decompose the multi objective\ntask into unrelated ones. It also calculates a theoretical weight that makes\nevery task reward has equal influence on the final RL value function.\nAdditionally, we introduce a communication method that helps agents cooperate\nwith each other. Experiments in simulation show that our method outperforms\nother end-to-end RL methods and our method can naturally scale to large world\nsizes where centralized planner struggles. We also deploy and validate our\nmethod in a real world scenario.\n",

        "abstract": "  We present a novel method for handling uncertainty about the intentions of\nnon-ego players in dynamic games, with application to motion planning for\nautonomous vehicles. Equilibria in these games explicitly account for\ninteraction among other agents in the environment, such as drivers and\npedestrians. Our method models the uncertainty about the intention of other\nagents by constructing multiple hypotheses about the objectives and constraints\nof other agents in the scene. For each candidate hypothesis, we associate a\nBernoulli random variable representing the probability of that hypothesis,\nwhich may or may not be independent of the probability of other hypotheses. We\nleverage constraint asymmetries and feedback information patterns to\nincorporate the probabilities of hypotheses in a natural way. Specifically,\nincreasing the probability associated with a given hypothesis from $0$ to $1$\nshifts the responsibility of collision avoidance from the hypothesized agent to\nthe ego agent. This method allows the generation of interactive trajectories\nfor the ego agent, where the level of assertiveness or caution that the ego\nexhibits is directly related to the easy-to-model uncertainty it maintains\nabout the scene.\n",

The quadrotors can transmit their estimates of the target\nlocations to other quadrotors that occupy their current location on the grid;\nthus, their communication network is time-varying and not necessarily\nconnected. We model the search procedure as a renewal-reward process on the\nunderlying DTDS Markov chain.

We build on previous works studying\nself-organizing behaviors in autonomous systems to derive a metric for swarm\nemergent self-organization. We utilize techniques from high performance\ncomputing, time series analysis, and queueing theory to derive metrics for\nswarm scalability, flexibility to changing external environments, and\nrobustness to internal system stimuli such as sensor and actuator noise and\nrobot failures. We demonstrate the utility of our metrics by analyzing four\ndifferent control algorithms in two scenarios: an indoor warehouse object\ntransport scenario with static objects and a spatially unconstrained outdoor\nsearch and rescue scenario with moving objects. In the spatially constrained\nwarehouse scenario, efficient use of space is key to success so algorithms that\nuse mechanisms for traffic regulation and congestion reduction are the most\nappropriate. In the search and rescue scenario, the same will happen with\nalgorithms which can cope well with object motion through dynamic task\nallocation and randomized search trajectories. We show that our intuitions\nabout comparative algorithm performance are well supported by the quantitative\nresults obtained using our metrics, and that our metrics can be synergistically\nused together to predict collective behaviors based on previous results in some\ncases.\n",

        "abstract": "  In this paper we develop the analytical framework for a novel Wireless\nsignal-based Sensing capability for Robotics (WSR) by leveraging robots'\nmobility. It allows robots to primarily measure relative direction, or\nAngle-of-Arrival (AOA), to other robots, while operating in non-line-of-sight\nunmapped environments and without requiring external infrastructure. We do so\nby capturing all of the paths that a wireless signal traverses as it travels\nfrom a transmitting to a receiving robot in the team, which we term as an AOA\nprofile. The key intuition behind our approach is to enable a robot to emulate\nantenna arrays as it moves freely in 2D and 3D space. The small differences in\nthe phase of the wireless signals are thus processed with knowledge of robots'\nlocal displacement to obtain the profile, via a method akin to Synthetic\nAperture Radar (SAR). The main contribution of this work is the development of\ni) a framework to accommodate arbitrary 2D and 3D motion, as well as continuous\nmobility of both signal transmitting and receiving robots, while computing AOA\nprofiles between them and ii) a Cramer-Rao Bound analysis, based on antenna\narray theory, that provides a lower bound on the variance in AOA estimation as\na function of the geometry of robot motion. We show that allowing robots to use\ntheir full mobility in 3D space while performing SAR, results in more accurate\nAOA profiles and thus better AOA estimation. All analytical developments are\nsubstantiated by extensive simulation and hardware experiments on air/ground\nrobot platforms using 5 GHz WiFi. Our experimental results bolster our\nanalytical findings, demonstrating that 3D motion provides enhanced and\nconsistent accuracy, with total AOA error of less than 10 degree for 95% of\ntrials.

In the practical setting of nodes with limited\nfield of views (FoVs), computing power and communication resources, we develop\na novel distributed multi-object tracking algorithm. To accomplish this, we\nfirst formalise the concept of label consistency, determine a sufficient\ncondition to achieve it and develop a novel \\textit{label consensus approach}\nthat reduces label inconsistency caused by objects' movements from one node's\nlimited FoV to another. Second, we develop a distributed multi-object fusion\nalgorithm that fuses local multi-object state estimates instead of local\nmulti-object densities. This algorithm: i) requires significantly less\nprocessing time than multi-object density fusion methods; ii) achieves better\ntracking accuracy by considering Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (OSPA) tracking\nerrors over several scans rather than a single scan; iii) is agnostic to local\nmulti-object tracking techniques, and only requires each node to provide a set\nof estimated tracks. Thus, it is not necessary to assume that the nodes\nmaintain multi-object densities, and hence the fusion outcomes do not modify\nlocal multi-object densities.

In this paper, a Decentralized\nAbility-Aware Adaptive Control is proposed to address these challenges based on\ntwo key features. Firstly, the common manipulation task is represented by the\nproposed nominal task ellipsoid, which is used to maximize each robot force\ncapability online via optimizing its configuration. Secondly, a decentralized\nadaptive controller is designed to be Lyapunov stable in spite of heterogeneous\nactuation constraints of the robots and uncertain physical parameters of the\nobject and environment. In the proposed framework, decentralized coordination\nand load distribution between the robots is achieved without communication,\nwhile only the control deficiency is broadcast if any of the robots reaches its\nforce limits. In this case, the object reference trajectory is modified in a\ndecentralized manner to guarantee stable interaction.

It has recently been shown that redundant\nassignment of agents to tasks provides robustness to uncertainty in task\nperformance. However, the question of how to fairly assign these redundant\nresources across tasks remains unaddressed. In this paper, we present a novel\nproblem formulation for fair redundant task allocation, which we cast as the\noptimization of worst-case task costs under a cardinality constraint. Solving\nthis problem optimally is NP-hard. We exploit properties of supermodularity to\npropose a polynomial-time, near-optimal solution. In supermodular redundant\nassignment, the use of additional agents always improves task costs. Therefore,\nwe provide a solution set that is $\\alpha$ times larger than the cardinality\nconstraint. This constraint relaxation enables our approach to achieve a\nsuper-optimal cost by using a sub-optimal assignment size. We derive the\nsub-optimality bound on this cardinality relaxation, $\\alpha$. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that our algorithm performs near-optimally without the cardinality\nrelaxation. We show simulations of redundant assignments of robots to goal\nnodes on transport networks with uncertain travel times.

        "abstract": "  This work focuses on low-energy collision avoidance and formation maintenance\nin autonomous swarms of drones. Here, the two main problems are: 1) how to\navoid collisions by temporarily breaking the formation, i.e., collision\navoidance reformation, and 2) how do such reformation while minimizing the\ndeviation resulting in minimization of the overall time and energy consumption\nof the drones. To address the first question, we use cellular automata based\ntechnique to find an efficient formation that avoids the obstacle while\nminimizing the time and energy. Concerning the second question, a near-optimal\nreformation of the swarm after successful collision avoidance is achieved by\napplying a temperature function reduction technique, originally used in the\npoint set registration process. The goal of the reformation process is to\nremove the disturbance while minimizing the overall time it takes for the swarm\nto reach the destination and consequently reducing the energy consumption\nrequired by this operation. To measure the degree of formation disturbance due\nto collision avoidance, deviation of the centroid of the swarm formation is\nused, inspired by the concept of the center of mass in classical mechanics.\nExperimental results show the efficiency of the proposed technique, in terms of\nperformance and energy.\n",

We evaluate GRIT on two datasets,\nshowing that GRIT achieved fast inference speed and comparable accuracy to two\ndeep learning baselines, a planning-based goal recognition method, and an\nablation of GRIT.

        "abstract": "  Leader-follower navigation is a popular class of multi-robot algorithms where\na leader robot leads the follower robots in a team. The leader has specialized\ncapabilities or mission-critical information (e.g. goal location) that the\nfollowers lack, and this makes the leader crucial for the mission's success.\nHowever, this also makes the leader a vulnerability - an external adversary who\nwishes to sabotage the robot team's mission can simply harm the leader and the\nwhole robot team's mission would be compromised. Since robot motion generated\nby traditional leader-follower navigation algorithms can reveal the identity of\nthe leader, we propose a defense mechanism of hiding the leader's identity by\nensuring the leader moves in a way that behaviorally camouflages it with the\nfollowers, making it difficult for an adversary to identify the leader. To\nachieve this, we combine Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Graph Neural\nNetworks and adversarial training. Our approach enables the multi-robot team to\noptimize the primary task performance with leader motion similar to follower\nmotion, behaviorally camouflaging it with the followers. Our algorithm\noutperforms existing work that tries to hide the leader's identity in a\nmulti-robot team by tuning traditional leader-follower control parameters with\nClassical Genetic Algorithms. We also evaluated human performance in inferring\nthe leader's identity and found that humans had lower accuracy when the robot\nteam used our proposed navigation algorithm.\n",

A\nnew formation potential fields (FPF) concept is proposed around a virtual\nagent, located at the center of the formation which ensures self-organization\nand maintenance of the formation. The path of the virtual agent is centrally\nplanned and the robots at the minima of the FPF are forced to move along with\nthe virtual agent. In the neighborhood of obstacles, individual robots\nselfishly avoid collisions, thus marginally deviating from the formation. The\nproposed quasi-centralized approach introduces formation flexibility into the\nMRS, which enables MRS to effectively navigate in an obstacle-ridden workspace.\nMethodical analysis of the proposed approach and guidelines for selecting the\nFPF are presented. Results using a candidate FPF are shown that ensure a\npentagonal formation effectively squeezes through a narrow passage avoiding any\ncollisions with the walls.\n",

Dynamic game\ntheory provides an expressive theoretical framework for modeling scenarios\ninvolving multiple agents with differing objectives interacting over time. A\ncore challenge when formulating a dynamic game is designing objectives for each\nagent that capture desired behavior. In this paper, we propose a method for\ninferring parametric objective models of multiple agents based on observed\ninteractions. Our inverse game solver jointly optimizes player objectives and\ncontinuous-state estimates by coupling them through Nash equilibrium\nconstraints. Hence, our method is able to directly maximize the observation\nlikelihood rather than other non-probabilistic surrogate criteria. Our method\ndoes not require full observations of game states or player strategies to\nidentify player objectives. Instead, it robustly recovers this information from\nnoisy, partial state observations. As a byproduct of estimating player\nobjectives, our method computes a Nash equilibrium trajectory corresponding to\nthose objectives. Thus, it is suitable for downstream trajectory forecasting\ntasks. We demonstrate our method in several simulated traffic scenarios.\nResults show that it reliably estimates player objectives from a short sequence\nof noise-corrupted partial state observations.

The framework can be applied to heterogeneous mobile\nrobot teams with distributed sub-tasks. Examples include pandemic robotic\nservice coordination, explore and rescue, and delivery systems with\nheterogeneous vehicles. Due to their inherent flexibility and robustness,\nmulti-agent systems are applied in a growing range of real-world problems that\ninvolve heterogeneous tasks and uncertain information. Most previous works\nassume one fixed way to decompose a task into roles that can later be assigned\nto the agents. This assumption is not valid for a complex task where the roles\ncan vary and multiple decomposition structures exist. Meanwhile, it is unclear\nhow uncertainties in task requirements and agent capabilities can be\nsystematically quantified and optimized under a multi-agent system setting. A\nrepresentation for complex tasks is proposed: agent capabilities are\nrepresented as a vector of random distributions, and task requirements are\nverified by a generalizable binary function. The conditional value at risk\n(CVaR) is chosen as a metric in the objective function to generate robust\nplans. An efficient algorithm is described to solve the model, and the whole\nframework is evaluated in two different practical test cases: capture-the-flag\nand robotic service coordination during a pandemic (e.g., COVID-19).

        "abstract": "  Multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problems involve optimizing the allocation\nof robots to tasks. MRTA problems are known to be challenging when tasks\nrequire multiple robots and the team is composed of heterogeneous robots. These\nchallenges are further exacerbated when we need to account for uncertainties\nencountered in the real-world. In this work, we address coalition formation in\nheterogeneous multi-robot teams with uncertain capabilities. We specifically\nfocus on tasks that require coalitions to collectively satisfy certain minimum\nrequirements. Existing approaches to uncertainty-aware task allocation either\nmaximize expected pay-off (risk-neutral approaches) or improve worst-case or\nnear-worst-case outcomes (risk-averse approaches). Within the context of our\nproblem, we demonstrate the inherent limitations of unilaterally ignoring or\navoiding risk and show that these approaches can in fact reduce the probability\nof satisfying task requirements. Inspired by models that explain foraging\nbehaviors in animals, we develop a risk-adaptive approach to task allocation.\nOur approach adaptively switches between risk-averse and risk-seeking behavior\nin order to maximize the probability of satisfying task requirements.\nComprehensive numerical experiments conclusively demonstrate that our\nrisk-adaptive approach outperforms risk-neutral and risk-averse approaches. We\nalso demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a simulated\nmulti-robot emergency response scenario.\n",

        "abstract": "  The task of searching for and tracking of multiple targets is a challenging\none. However, most works in this area do not consider evasive targets that move\nfaster than the agents comprising the multi-robot system. This is due to the\nassumption that the movement patterns of such targets, combined with their\nexcessive speed, would make the task nearly impossible to accomplish. In this\nwork, we show that this is not the case and we propose a decentralized search\nand tracking strategy in which the level of exploration and exploitation\ncarried out by the swarm is adjustable. By tuning a swarm's exploration and\nexploitation dynamics, we demonstrate that there exists an optimal balance\nbetween the level of exploration and exploitation performed. This optimum\nmaximizes its tracking performance and changes depending on the number of\ntargets and the targets' movement profiles. We also show that the use of\nagent-based memory is critical in enabling the tracking of an evasive target.\nThe obtained simulation results are validated through experimental tests with a\ndecentralized swarm of six robots tracking a virtual fast-moving target.\n",

        "abstract": "  This paper studies a novel encirclement guaranteed cooperative pursuit\nproblem involving $N$ pursuers and a single evader in an unbounded\ntwo-dimensional game domain. Throughout the game, the pursuers are required to\nmaintain encirclement of the evader, i.e., the evader should always stay inside\nthe convex hull generated by all the pursuers, in addition to achieving the\nclassical capture condition. To tackle this challenging cooperative pursuit\nproblem, a robust model predictive control (RMPC) based formulation framework\nis first introduced, which simultaneously accounts for the encirclement and\ncapture requirements under the assumption that the evader's action is\nunavailable to all pursuers. Despite the reformulation, the resulting RMPC\nproblem involves a bilinear constraint due to the encirclement requirement. To\nfurther handle such a bilinear constraint, a novel encirclement guaranteed\npartitioning scheme is devised that simplifies the original bilinear RMPC\nproblem to a number of linear tube MPC (TMPC) problems solvable in a\ndecentralized manner. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed solution framework. Furthermore, comparisons with existing\napproaches show that the explicit consideration of the encirclement condition\nsignificantly improves the chance of successful capture of the evader in\nvarious scenarios.\n",

Recent work in automated\napproaches to learning swarm behavior has been limited to individual primitives\nwith sparse work on learning complete missions. This paper presents a\nsystematic approach to learn tactical mission-specific policies that compose\nprimitives in a swarm to accomplish the mission efficiently using neural\nnetworks with special input and output encoding. To learn swarm tactics in an\nadversarial environment, we employ a combination of 1) map-to-graph\nabstraction, 2) input/output encoding via Pareto filtering of points of\ninterest and clustering of robots, and 3) learning via neuroevolution and\npolicy gradient approaches. We illustrate this combination as critical to\nproviding tractable learning, especially given the computational cost of\nsimulating swarm missions of this scale and complexity.

By taking into\naccount the intent of every agent, the ego agent can incorporate future\ninteractions with human-driven vehicles into its planning. The problem is often\nformulated as a multi-agent game and solved using iterative algorithms\noperating on a discretized action or state space. Even if converging to a Nash\nequilibrium, the result will often be only sub-optimal. In this paper, we\ndefine a linear differential game for a set of interacting agents and solve it\nto optimality using mixed-integer programming. A disjunctive formulation of the\norientation allows us to formulate linear constraints to prevent agent-to-agent\ncollision while preserving the non-holonomic motion properties of the vehicle\nmodel. Soft constraints account for prediction errors. We then define a joint\ncost function, where a cooperation factor can adapt between altruistic,\ncooperative, and egoistic behavior. We study the influence of the cooperation\nfactor to solve scenarios, where interaction between the agents is necessary to\nsolve them successfully. The approach is then evaluated in a racing scenario,\nwhere we show the applicability of the formulation in a closed-loop receding\nhorizon replanning fashion.

We calculate the\nthroughput for a fixed time and the asymptotic throughput for these strategies.\nAdditionally, we corroborate these results by simulations, showing that when a\nstrategy has higher throughput, its arrival time per number of robots is lower.\nThus, we conclude that using throughput is well suited for comparing congestion\nalgorithms for a common target area in robotic swarms even if we do not have\ntheir closed asymptotic equation.\n",

        "abstract": "  When a large number of robots try to reach a common area, congestions happen,\ncausing severe delays. To minimise congestion in a robotic swarm system,\ntraffic control algorithms must be employed in a decentralised manner. Based on\nstrategies aimed to maximise the throughput of the common target area, we\ndeveloped two novel algorithms for robots using artificial potential fields for\nobstacle avoidance and navigation. One algorithm is inspired by creating a\nqueue to get to the target area (Single Queue Former -- SQF), while the other\nmakes the robots touch the boundary of the circular area by using vector fields\n(Touch and Run Vector Fields -- TRVF). We performed simulation experiments to\nshow that the proposed algorithms are bounded by the throughput of their\ninspired theoretical strategies and compare the two novel algorithms with\nstate-of-art algorithms for the same problem (PCC, EE and PCC-EE). The SQF\nalgorithm significantly outperforms all other algorithms for a large number of\nrobots or when the circular target region radius is small. TRVF, on the other\nhand, is better than SQF only for a limited number of robots and outperforms\nonly PCC for numerous robots. However, it allows us to analyse the potential\nimpacts on the throughput when transferring an idea from a theoretical strategy\nto a concrete algorithm that considers changing linear speeds and distances\nbetween robots.\n",

Conflict Based Search (CBS) is a leading complete\nand optimal MAPF solver which lazily explores the joint agent state space,\nusing an admissible heuristic joint plan. Such an admissible heuristic joint\nplan is computed by combining individual shortest paths found without\nconsidering inter-agent conflicts, and which becomes gradually more informed as\nconstraints are added to individual agents' path planning problems to avoid\ndiscovered conflicts. In this paper, we seek to speedup CBS by finding a more\ninformed heuristic joint plan which is bounded from above. We first propose the\nbudgeted Class-Ordered A* (bCOA*), a novel algorithm that finds the shortest\npath with minimal number of conflicts that is upper bounded in terms of length.\nThen, we propose a novel bounded-cost variant of CBS, called CBS-Budget (CBSB)\nby using a bCOA* search at the low-level search of the CBS and by using a\nmodified focal search at the high-level search of the CBS. We prove that CBSB\nis complete and bounded-suboptimal. In our numerical experiments, CBSB finds a\nnear optimal solution for hundreds of agents within a fraction of a second.\nCBSB shows state-of-the-art performance, comparable to Explicit Estimation CBS\n(EECBS), an enhanced recent version of CBS. On the other hand, CBSB is easier\nto implement than EECBS, since only two priority queues at the high-level\nsearch are needed as in Enhanced CBS (ECBS).\n",

ACHORD provides bandwidth prioritization and timely and\nreliable data transfer despite intermittent connectivity.

        "abstract": "  A mobile robot's precise location information is critical for navigation and\ntask processing, especially for a multi-robot system (MRS) to collaborate and\ncollect valuable data from the field. However, a robot in situations where it\ndoes not have access to GPS signals, such as in an environmentally controlled,\nindoor, or underground environment, finds it difficult to locate using its\nsensor alone. As a result, robots sharing their local information to improve\ntheir localization estimates benefit the entire MRS team. There have been\nseveral attempts to model-based multi-robot localization using Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) as a source to calculate bearing information. We also\nutilize the RSSI for wireless networks generated through the communication of\nmultiple robots in a system and aim to localize agents with high accuracy and\nefficiency in a dynamic environment for shared information fusion to refine the\nlocalization estimation. This estimator structure reduces one source of\nmeasurement correlation while appropriately incorporating others. This paper\nproposes a decentralized Multi-robot Synergistic Localization System (MRSL) for\na dense and dynamic environment. Robots update their position estimation\nwhenever new information receives from their neighbors. When the system senses\nthe presence of other robots in the region, it exchanges position estimates and\nmerges the received data to improve its localization accuracy. Our approach\nuses Bayesian rule-based integration, which has shown to be computationally\nefficient and applicable to asynchronous robotics communication. We have\nperformed extensive simulation experiments with a varying number of robots to\nanalyze the algorithm.

        "abstract": "  This paper introduces a novel social preference-aware decentralized safe\ncontrol framework to address the responsibility allocation problem in\nmulti-agent collision avoidance. Considering that agents do not necessarily\ncooperate in symmetric ways, this paper focuses on semi-cooperative behavior\namong heterogeneous agents with varying cooperation levels. Drawing upon the\nidea of Social Value Orientation (SVO) for quantifying the individual\nselfishness, we propose a novel concept of Responsibility-associated Social\nValue Orientation (R-SVO) to express the intended relative social implications\nbetween pairwise agents. This is used to redefine each agent's social\npreferences or personalities in terms of corresponding responsibility shares in\ncontributing to the coordination scenario, such as semi-cooperative collision\navoidance where all agents interact in an asymmetric way. By incorporating such\nrelative social implications through proposed Local Pairwise Responsibility\nWeights, we develop a Responsibility-associated Control Barrier Function-based\nsafe control framework for individual agents, and multi-agent collision\navoidance is achieved with formally provable safety guarantees. Simulations are\nprovided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed\nframework in several multi-agent navigation tasks, such as a position-swapping\ngame, a self-driving car highway ramp merging scenario, and a circular position\nswapping game.\n",

Through this review, we identify a dearth of work that\nholistically tackles the problem of co-design and co-optimization of robots and\nthe networks they employ.

        "abstract": "  Safety guarantees in motion planning for autonomous driving typically involve\ncertifying the trajectory to be collision-free under any motion of the\nuncontrollable participants in the environment, such as the human-driven\nvehicles on the road. As a result they usually employ a conservative bound on\nthe behavior of such participants, such as reachability analysis. We point out\nthat planning trajectories to rigorously avoid the entirety of the reachable\nregions is unnecessary and too restrictive, because observing the environment\nin the future will allow us to prune away most of them; disregarding this\nability to react to future updates could prohibit solutions to scenarios that\nare easily navigated by human drivers. We propose to account for the autonomous\nvehicle's reactions to future environment changes by a novel safety framework,\nComprehensive Reactive Safety. Validated in simulations in several urban\ndriving scenarios such as unprotected left turns and lane merging, the\nresulting planning algorithm called Reactive ILQR demonstrates strong\nnegotiation capabilities and better safety at the same time.\n",

Due to its complexity, existing algorithms either\nutilize simplifying assumptions or are incomplete. This work introduces\nkinodynamic conflict-based search (K-CBS), a decentralized (decoupled) MRMP\nalgorithm that is general, scalable, and probabilistically complete. The\nalgorithm takes inspiration from successful solutions to the discrete analogue\nof MRMP over finite graphs, known as multi-agent path finding (MAPF).\nSpecifically, we adapt ideas from conflict-based search (CBS) - a popular\ndecentralized MAPF algorithm - to the MRMP setting. The novelty in this\nadaptation is that we work directly in the continuous domain, without the need\nfor discretization. In particular, the kinodynamic constraints are treated\nnatively. K-CBS plans for each robot individually using a low-level planner and\nand grows a conflict tree to resolve collisions between robots by defining\nconstraints for individual robots. The low-level planner can be any\nsampling-based, tree-search algorithm for kinodynamic robots, thus lifting\nexisting planners for single robots to the multi-robot settings. We show that\nK-CBS inherits the (probabilistic) completeness of the low-level planner. We\nillustrate the generality and performance of K-CBS in several case studies and\nbenchmarks.\n",

        "abstract": "  The plethora of sensors in our commodity devices provides a rich substrate\nfor sensor-fused tracking. Yet, today's solutions are unable to deliver robust\nand high tracking accuracies across multiple agents in practical, everyday\nenvironments - a feature central to the future of immersive and collaborative\napplications. This can be attributed to the limited scope of diversity\nleveraged by these fusion solutions, preventing them from catering to the\nmultiple dimensions of accuracy, robustness (diverse environmental conditions)\nand scalability (multiple agents) simultaneously. In this work, we take an\nimportant step towards this goal by introducing the notion of dual-layer\ndiversity to the problem of sensor fusion in multi-agent tracking. We\ndemonstrate that the fusion of complementary tracking modalities, -\npassive/relative (e.g., visual odometry) and active/absolute tracking (e.g.,\ninfrastructure-assisted RF localization) offer a key first layer of diversity\nthat brings scalability while the second layer of diversity lies in the\nmethodology of fusion, where we bring together the complementary strengths of\nalgorithmic (for robustness) and data-driven (for accuracy) approaches. RoVaR\nis an embodiment of such a dual-layer diversity approach that intelligently\nattends to cross-modal information using algorithmic and data-driven techniques\nthat jointly share the burden of accurately tracking multiple agents in the\nwild. Extensive evaluations reveal RoVaR's multi-dimensional benefits in terms\nof tracking accuracy (median of 15cm), robustness (in unseen environments),\nlight weight (runs in real-time on mobile platforms such as Jetson Nano/TX2),\nto enable practical multi-agent immersive applications in everyday\nenvironments.\n",

The main attractiveness of such systems is their\nflexibility, robustness, and scalability. An often overlooked yet promising\nfeature is system modularity, which offers the possibility to harness agent\nspecialization, while also enabling system-level upgrades. However, altering\nthe agents' capacities can change the exploration-exploitation balance required\nto maximize the system's performance. Here, we study the effect of a swarm's\nheterogeneity on its exploration-exploitation balance while tracking multiple\nfast-moving evasive targets under the Cooperative Multi-Robot Observation of\nMultiple Moving Targets framework. To this end, we use a decentralized search\nand tracking strategy with adjustable levels of exploration and exploitation.\nBy indirectly tuning the balance, we first confirm the presence of an optimal\nbalance between these two key competing actions. Next, by substituting slower\nmoving agents with faster ones, we show that the system exhibits a performance\nimprovement without any modifications to the original strategy. In addition,\nowing to the additional amount of exploitation carried out by the faster\nagents, we demonstrate that a heterogeneous system's performance can be further\nimproved by reducing an agent's level of connectivity, to favor the conduct of\nexploratory actions. Furthermore, in studying the influence of the density of\nswarming agents, we show that the addition of faster agents can counterbalance\na reduction in the overall number of agents while maintaining the level of\ntracking performance.

Ideally, the weights should\nbe inversely proportional to the error in the sensing information. However,\nprevious cooperative sensor fusion approaches for autonomous vehicles use a\nfixed error model, in which the covariance of a sensor and its recognizer\npipeline is just the mean of the measured covariance for all sensing scenarios.\nThe approach proposed in this paper estimates error using key predictor terms\nthat have high correlation with sensing and localization accuracy for accurate\ncovariance estimation of each sensor observation. We adopt a tiered fusion\nmodel consisting of local and global sensor fusion steps. At the local fusion\nlevel, we add in a covariance generation stage using the error model for each\nsensor and the measured distance to generate the expected covariance matrix for\neach observation. At the global sensor fusion stage we add an additional stage\nto generate the localization covariance matrix from the key predictor term\nvelocity and combines that with the covariance generated from the local fusion\nfor accurate cooperative sensing. To showcase our method, we built a set of\n1/10 scale model autonomous vehicles with scale accurate sensing capabilities\nand classified the error characteristics against a motion capture system.\nResults show an average and max improvement in RMSE when detecting vehicle\npositions of 1.42x and 1.78x respectively in a four-vehicle cooperative fusion\nscenario when using our error model versus a typical fixed error model.\n",

In\nparticular, given a MAPF problem with at least two holes, we present an\nalgorithm that checks the problem feasibility in linear time with respect to\nthe number of nodes, and provides a feasible solution in polynomial time.\n",

Thanks to the\nMNF formulation, agents can contribute to each other's coordination via partial\nand/or total associations, contrary to traditional decentralized navigation\nfunctions (DNFs). In particular, agents may stimulate each other via their\nMNFs. Moreover, MNFs need to be confined which is a weaker condition compared\nto the Morse condition of DNFs. An MNF is composed of a confined function and\nan attraction kernel. The critical points of the former can be confined in a\nsafe region around a target critical point. The collision-free trajectory of an\nagent and its associations to its peers are governed by a confined function\nbefore reaching its safe region. Then, the attraction kernel drives the agent\nto its target in the safe region. MNFs provide faster coordination compared to\nDNFs. We illustrate how MNFs may exhibit some social behaviors in the course of\npartial and total associations among agents. Our simulations verify the\nefficiency of MNFs to coordinate complex swarms of agents.\n",

Furthermore, is there an optimal path for the\nrobots? To deal with the two problems, a novel graphbased motion planner is\nproposed in this paper. A mapping between workspace and configuration space of\nmulti-mobile robot systems is first built, where valid configurations can be\nacquired to satisfy both formation constraints and collision avoidance.

The breadth-first search method is employed to answer the\nquestion of whether there is a feasible path on the graph.

        "abstract": "  Proper functioning of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for\nthe safety and efficiency of future intelligent transport systems. Meanwhile,\ntransitioning to fully autonomous driving requires a long period of mixed\nautonomy traffic, including both CAVs and human-driven vehicles. Thus,\ncollaboration decision-making for CAVs is essential to generate appropriate\ndriving behaviors to enhance the safety and efficiency of mixed autonomy\ntraffic. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely\nused in solving decision-making problems. However, the existing DRL-based\nmethods have been mainly focused on solving the decision-making of a single\nCAV. Using the existing DRL-based methods in mixed autonomy traffic cannot\naccurately represent the mutual effects of vehicles and model dynamic traffic\nenvironments. To address these shortcomings, this article proposes a graph\nreinforcement learning (GRL) approach for multi-agent decision-making of CAVs\nin mixed autonomy traffic. First, a generic and modular GRL framework is\ndesigned. Then, a systematic review of DRL and GRL methods is presented,\nfocusing on the problems addressed in recent research. Moreover, a comparative\nstudy on different GRL methods is further proposed based on the designed\nframework to verify the effectiveness of GRL methods. Results show that the GRL\nmethods can well optimize the performance of multi-agent decision-making for\nCAVs in mixed autonomy traffic compared to the DRL methods. Finally, challenges\nand future research directions are summarized. This study can provide a\nvaluable research reference for solving the multi-agent decision-making\nproblems of CAVs in mixed autonomy traffic and can promote the implementation\nof GRL-based methods into intelligent transportation systems.

However, this is difficult to achieve\nsince there is no generic framework to transfer skills between agents other\nthan a query-response-based approach. Moreover, natural living systems have a\n\"forgetfulness\" property for everything they learn. Analyzing such ephemeral\nnature (temporal memory properties of new knowledge gained) in artificial\nsystems has never been studied in the literature. We propose a behavior\ntree-based framework to realize a query-response mechanism for transferring\nskills encoded as the condition-action control sub-flow of that portion of the\nknowledge between agents to fill this gap. We simulate a multiagent group with\ndifferent initial knowledge on a foraging mission. While performing basic\noperations, each robot queries other robots to respond to an unknown condition.\nThe responding robot shares the control actions by sharing a portion of the\nbehavior tree that addresses the queries. Specifically, we investigate the\nephemeral nature of the new knowledge gained through such a framework, where\nthe knowledge gained by the agent is either limited due to memory or is\nforgotten over time. Our investigations show that knowledge grows\nproportionally with the duration of remembrance, which is trivial. However, we\nfound minimal impact on knowledge growth due to memory. We compare these cases\nagainst a baseline that involved full knowledge pre-coded on all agents. We\nfound that knowledge-sharing strived to match the baseline condition by sharing\nand achieving knowledge growth as a collective system.\n",

Existing task allocation algorithms often assume prior knowledge of\ntask location and demand or fail to consider the effects of the geometric\ndistribution of tasks on the completion time and communication cost of the\nalgorithms. In this paper, we examine an environment where agents must explore\nand discover tasks with positive demand and successfully assign themselves to\ncomplete all such tasks. We first provide a new discrete general model for\nmodeling swarms. Operating within this theoretical framework, we propose two\nnew task allocation algorithms for initially unknown environments -- one based\non N-site selection and the other on virtual pheromones. We analyze each\nalgorithm separately and also evaluate the effectiveness of the two algorithms\nin dense vs. sparse task distributions. Compared to the Levy walk, which has\nbeen theorized to be optimal for foraging, our virtual pheromone inspired\nalgorithm is much faster in sparse to medium task densities but is\ncommunication and agent intensive. Our site selection inspired algorithm also\noutperforms Levy walk in sparse task densities and is a less resource-intensive\noption than our virtual pheromone algorithm for this case. Because the\nperformance of both algorithms relative to random walk is dependent on task\ndensity, our results shed light on how task density is important in choosing a\ntask allocation algorithm in initially unknown environments.\n",

For a\nlong time in the future, workers and robots will coexist and collaborate with\neach other to build or maintain a facility efficiently. As an emerging field,\nhuman-robot collaboration (HRC) still faces various open problems. To this end,\nthis pioneer research introduces an agent-based modeling approach to\ninvestigate the coupling effect and scale effect of HRC in the bricklaying\nprocess. With multiple experiments based on simulation, the dynamic and complex\nnature of HRC is illustrated in two folds: 1) agents in HRC are interdependent\ndue to human factors of workers, features of robots, and their collaboration\nbehaviors; 2) different parameters of HRC are correlated and have significant\nimpacts on construction productivity (CP). Accidentally and interestingly, it\nis discovered that HRC has a scale effect on CP, which means increasing the\nnumber of collaborated human-robot teams will lead to higher CP even if the\nhuman-robot ratio keeps unchanged. Overall, it is argued that more\ninvestigations in HRC are needed for efficient construction, occupational\nsafety, etc.; and this research can be taken as a stepstone for developing and\nevaluating new robots, optimizing HRC processes, and even training future\nindustrial workers in the construction industry.\n",
