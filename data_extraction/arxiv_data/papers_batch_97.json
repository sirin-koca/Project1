        "abstract": "  We consider a variant of the target defense problem where a single defender\nis tasked to capture a sequence of incoming intruders. The intruders' objective\nis to breach the target boundary without being captured by the defender. As\nsoon as the current intruder breaches the target or gets captured by the\ndefender, the next intruder appears at a random location on a fixed circle\nsurrounding the target. Therefore, the defender's final location at the end of\nthe current game becomes its initial location for the next game. Thus, the\nplayers pick strategies that are advantageous for the current as well as for\nthe future games. Depending on the information available to the players, each\ngame is divided into two phases: partial information and full information\nphase. Under some assumptions on the sensing and speed capabilities, we analyze\nthe agents' strategies in both phases. We derive equilibrium strategies for\nboth the players to optimize the capture percentage using the notions of\nengagement surface and capture circle. We quantify the percentage of capture\nfor both finite and infinite sequences of incoming intruders.\n",

        "abstract": "  Smart City applications, such as traffic monitoring and disaster response,\noften use swarms of intelligent and cooperative drones to efficiently collect\nsensor data over different areas of interest and time spans. However, when the\nrequired sensing becomes spatio-temporally large and varying, a collective\narrangement of sensing tasks to a large number of battery-restricted and\ndistributed drones is challenging. To address this problem, this paper\nintroduces a scalable and energy-aware model for planning and coordination of\nspatio-temporal sensing. The coordination model is built upon a decentralized\nmulti-agent collective learning algorithm (EPOS) to ensure scalability,\nresilience, and flexibility that existing approaches lack of. Experimental\nresults illustrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method compared\nto state-of-the-art methods. Analytical results contribute a deeper\nunderstanding of how coordinated mobility of drones influences sensing\nperformance. This novel coordination solution is applied to traffic monitoring\nusing real-world data to demonstrate a $46.45\\%$ more accurate and $2.88\\%$\nmore efficient detection of vehicles as the number of drones become a scarce\nresource.\n",

        "abstract": "  Developments in cooperative trajectory planning of connected autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) have gathered considerable momentum and research attention.\nGenerally, such problems present strong non-linearity and non-convexity,\nrendering great difficulties in finding the optimal solution. Existing methods\ntypically suffer from low computational efficiency, and this hinders the\nappropriate applications in large-scale scenarios involving an increasing\nnumber of vehicles. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel decentralized\niterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) algorithm by leveraging the dual\nconsensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). First, the\noriginal non-convex optimization problem is reformulated into a series of\nconvex optimization problems through iterative neighbourhood approximation.\nThen, the dual of each convex optimization problem is shown to have a consensus\nstructure, which facilitates the use of consensus ADMM to solve for the dual\nsolution in a fully decentralized and parallel architecture. Finally, the\nprimal solution corresponding to the trajectory of each vehicle is recovered by\nsolving a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem iteratively, and a novel\ntrajectory update strategy is proposed to ensure the dynamic feasibility of\nvehicles. With the proposed development, the computation burden is\nsignificantly alleviated such that real-time performance is attainable. Two\ntraffic scenarios are presented to validate the proposed algorithm, and\nthorough comparisons between our proposed method and baseline methods\n(including centralized iLQR, IPOPT, and SQP) are conducted to demonstrate the\nscalability of the proposed approach.\n",

In this work, we propose a\nDecentralized Blocklist Protocol (DBP) based on inter-robot accusations.\nAccusations are made on the basis of locally-made observations of misbehavior,\nand once shared by cooperative robots across the network are used as input to a\ngraph matching algorithm that computes a blocklist. DBP generalizes to\napplications not implemented via LCP, is adaptive to the number of Byzantine\nrobots, and allows for fast information propagation through the multi-robot\nsystem while simultaneously reducing the required network connectivity relative\nto W-MSR. On LCP-type applications, DBP reduces the worst-case connectivity\nrequirement of W-MSR from (2F+1)-connected to (F+1)-connected and the number of\ncooperative observers required to propagate new information from F+1 to just 1\nobserver. We demonstrate empirically that our approach to Byzantine resilience\nscales to hundreds of robots on cooperative target tracking, time\nsynchronization, and localization case studies.\n",

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become\nparticularly popular in such applications, promising to cover large areas at\nhigh speeds. Moreover, with the increasing maturity of onboard UAV perception,\nresearch focus has been shifting toward higher-level reasoning for single- and\nmulti-robot missions. However, autonomous navigation and exploration of\npreviously unknown large spaces still constitutes an open challenge, especially\nwhen the environment is cluttered and exhibits large and frequent occlusions\ndue to high obstacle density, as is the case of forests. Moreover, the problem\nof long-distance wireless communication in such scenes can become a limiting\nfactor, especially when automating the navigation of a UAV swarm. In this\nspirit, this work proposes an exploration strategy that enables UAVs, both\nindividually and in small swarms, to quickly explore complex scenes in a\ndecentralized fashion. By providing the decision-making capabilities to each\nUAV to switch between different execution modes, the proposed strategy strikes\na great balance between cautious exploration of yet completely unknown regions\nand more aggressive exploration of smaller areas of unknown space. This results\nin full coverage of forest areas of variable density, consistently faster than\nthe state of the art. Demonstrating successful deployment with a single UAV as\nwell as a swarm of up to three UAVs, this work sets out the basic principles\nfor multi-root exploration of cluttered scenes, with up to 65% speed up in the\nsingle UAV case and 40% increase in explored area for the same mission time in\nmulti-UAV setups.\n",

Our\npurpose is to manage a group of automated robots that provide package delivery\nservices in a building where pedestrians and a wide variety of robots coexist,\nsuch as delivery services in office buildings, hospitals, and apartments. It is\noften the case with these real-world applications that the time required for\nthe robots to traverse a corridor takes a continuous value and is randomly\ndistributed, and the prior knowledge of the probability distribution of the\ntravel time is limited. Multi-Agent Path Finding has been widely studied and\napplied to robot management systems; however, automating the robot operation in\nsuch environments remains difficult. We propose 1) online re-planning to update\nthe action plan of robots while it is executed, and 2) parameter update to\nestimate the probability distribution of travel time using Bayesian inference\nas the delay is observed. We use a greedy heuristic to obtain solutions in a\nlimited computation time. Through simulations, we empirically compare the\nperformance of our method to those of existing methods in terms of the conflict\nprobability and the actual travel time of robots. The simulation results\nindicate that the proposed method can find travel paths with at least 50% fewer\nconflicts and a shorter actual total travel time than existing methods.

The technique is based on the flocking and\ncollective navigation behavior observed in natural swarms, such as cattle\nherds, bird flocks, and even large groups of humans. As global and concurrent\ninformation of all swarm members is not available in natural swarms, these\nsystems use local observations to achieve the desired behavior. Similarly,\nPACNav relies only on local observations of relative positions of UAVs, making\nit suitable for large swarms deprived of communication capabilities and\nexternal localization systems. We introduce the novel concepts of path\npersistence and path similarity that allow each swarm member to analyze the\nmotion of other members in order to determine its own future motion. PACNav is\nbased on two main principles: (1) UAVs with little variation in motion\ndirection have high path persistence, and are considered by other UAVs to be\nreliable leaders; (2) groups of UAVs that move in a similar direction have high\npath similarity, and such groups are assumed to contain a reliable leader. The\nproposed approach also embeds a reactive collision avoidance mechanism to avoid\ncollisions with swarm members and environmental obstacles. This collision\navoidance ensures safety while reducing deviations from the assigned path.\nAlong with several simulated experiments, we present a real-world experiment in\na natural forest, showcasing the validity and effectiveness of the proposed\ncollective navigation approach in challenging environments.

However, existing methods tend to ignore the fact that\nnot all traits equally contribute to a given task. Ignoring such inherent\npreferences or relative importance can lead to unintended sub-optimal\nallocations of limited agent resources that do not necessarily contribute to\ntask success. Further, reasoning over a large number of traits can incur a\nhefty computational burden. To alleviate these concerns, we propose an\nalgorithm to infer task-specific trait preferences implicit in expert\ndemonstrations. We leverage the insight that the consistency with which an\nexpert allocates a trait to a task across demonstrations reflects the trait's\nimportance to that task. Inspired by findings in psychology, we account for the\nfact that the inherent diversity of a trait in the dataset influences the\ndataset's informativeness and, thereby, the extent of the inferred preference\nor the lack thereof. Through detailed numerical simulations and evaluations of\na publicly-available soccer dataset (FIFA 20), we demonstrate that we can\nsuccessfully infer implicit trait preferences and that accounting for the\ninferred preferences leads to more computationally efficient and effective task\nallocation, compared to a baseline approach that treats all traits equally.\n",

The LOS connectivity between pairwise robots is\npreserved when two robots stay within the limited communication range and their\nLOS remains occlusion-free from static obstacles while moving. By using control\nbarrier functions (CBF) and minimum volume enclosing ellipsoids (MVEE), we\nfirst introduce the LOS connectivity barrier certificate (LOS-CBC) to\ncharacterize the state-dependent admissible control space for pairwise robots,\nfrom which their resulting motion will keep the two robots LOS connected over\ntime. We then propose the Minimum Line-of-Sight Connectivity Constraint\nSpanning Tree (MLCCST) as a step-wise bilevel optimization framework to jointly\noptimize (a) the minimum set of LOS edges to actively maintain, and (b) the\ncontrol revision with respect to a nominal multi-robot controller due to LOS\nconnectivity maintenance. As proved in the theoretical analysis, this allows\nthe robots to improvise the optimal composition of LOS-CBC control constraints\nthat are least constraining around the nominal controllers, and at the same\ntime enforce the global and subgroup LOS connectivity through the resulting\npreserved set of pairwise LOS edges. The framework thus leads to robots staying\nas close to their nominal behaviors, while exhibiting dynamically changing\nLOS-connected network topology that provides the greatest flexibility for the\nexisting multi-robot tasks in real time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach through simulations with up to 64 robots.\n",

The area detection information is represented by the equivalent\nvisiting time map (EVTM), which is built based on the detection probability and\nthe actual visiting time of the area.

An algorithm named task assignment\nminimum-cost maximum-flow (TAMM) is proposed. Cooperative behavior\ndecision-making uses Fisher information as the mission reward to obtain the\noptimal tracking action of the UAV. Furthermore, a coverage behavior\ndecision-making algorithm based on the anti-flocking method is designed for\nthose UAVs assigned the coverage task.

In such missions, robots are deployed to locate targets,\nsuch as human survivors, but they might get trapped at hazardous locations,\nsuch as in a trapping pit or by debris. Thus, the information the robot\ncollected is lost owing to the lack of communication. In our prior work, we\ndeveloped the notion of a path-based sensor. A path-based sensor detects\nwhether or not an event has occurred along a particular path, but it does not\nprovide the exact location of the event. Such path-based sensor observations\nare well-suited to communication-denied environments, and various studies have\nexplored methods to improve information gathering in such settings. In some\nmissions it is typical for target elements to be in close proximity to\nhazardous factors that hinder the information-gathering process. In this study,\nwe examine a similar scenario and conduct experiments to determine if\nadditional knowledge about the correlation between hazards and targets improves\nthe efficiency of information gathering.

        "abstract": "  Task allocation can enable effective coordination of multi-robot teams to\naccomplish tasks that are intractable for individual robots. However, existing\napproaches to task allocation often assume that task requirements or reward\nfunctions are known and explicitly specified by the user. In this work, we\nconsider the challenge of forming effective coalitions for a given\nheterogeneous multi-robot team when task reward functions are unknown. To this\nend, we first formulate a new class of problems, dubbed COncurrent Constrained\nOnline optimization of Allocation (COCOA). The COCOA problem requires online\noptimization of coalitions such that the unknown rewards of all the tasks are\nsimultaneously maximized using a given multi-robot team with constrained\nresources. To address the COCOA problem, we introduce an online optimization\nalgorithm, named Concurrent Multi-Task Adaptive Bandits (CMTAB), that leverages\nand builds upon continuum-armed bandit algorithms. Experiments involving\ndetailed numerical simulations and a simulated emergency response task reveal\nthat CMTAB can effectively trade-off exploration and exploitation to\nsimultaneously and efficiently optimize the unknown task rewards while\nrespecting the team's resource constraints.\n",

        "abstract": "  Inter-individual differences are studied in natural systems, such as fish,\nbees, and humans, as they contribute to the complexity of both individual and\ncollective behaviors. However, individuality in artificial systems, such as\nrobotic swarms, is undervalued or even overlooked. Agent-specific deviations\nfrom the norm in swarm robotics are usually understood as mere noise that can\nbe minimized, for example, by calibration. We observe that robots have\nconsistent deviations and argue that awareness and knowledge of these can be\nexploited to serve a task. We measure heterogeneity in robot swarms caused by\nindividual differences in how robots act, sense, and oscillate. Our use case is\nKilobots and we provide example behaviors where the performance of robots\nvaries depending on individual differences. We show a non-intuitive example of\nphototaxis with Kilobots where the non-calibrated Kilobots show better\nperformance than the calibrated supposedly ``ideal\" one. We measure the\ninter-individual variations for heterogeneity in sensing and oscillation, too.\nWe briefly discuss how these variations can enhance the complexity of\ncollective behaviors. We suggest that by recognizing and exploring this new\nperspective on individuality, and hence diversity, in robotic swarms, we can\ngain a deeper understanding of these systems and potentially unlock new\npossibilities for their design and implementation of applications.\n",

However, due\nto the complexity of unmanned warehouse systems and their susceptibility to\nerrors, incidents may occur during their operation, most often in inbound and\noutbound operations, which can decrease operational efficiency. Hence it is\ncrucial to to improve the response to such incidents. This paper proposes a\ncollaborative optimization algorithm for emergent incident response based on\nSafe-MADDPG. To meet safety requirements during emergent incident response, we\ninvestigated the intrinsic hidden relationships between various factors. By\nobtaining constraint information of agents during the emergent incident\nresponse process and of the dynamic environment of unmanned warehouses on\nagents, the algorithm reduces safety risks and avoids the occurrence of chain\naccidents; this enables an unmanned system to complete emergent incident\nresponse tasks and achieve its optimization objectives: (1) minimizing the\nlosses caused by emergent incidents; and (2) maximizing the operational\nefficiency of inbound and outbound operations during the response process.

This paper presents Loopy, a \"Swarm-of-One\" polymorphic robot\ntestbed that can be viewed simultaneously as a robotic swarm and a single\nrobot. Loopy's shape is determined jointly by self-organization and\nmorphological computing using physically linked homogeneous cells. Experimental\nresults show that Loopy can form symmetric shapes consisting of lobes. Using\nthe the same set of parameters, even small amounts of initial noise can change\nthe number of lobes formed. However, once in a stable configuration, Loopy has\nan \"inertia\" to transfiguring in response to dynamic parameters.

Experimental results demonstrates that our model\nis powerful enough to generalize even to situations with more vehicles than in\nthe training data.

        "abstract": "  Relative state estimation using exteroceptive sensors suffers from\nlimitations of the field of view (FOV) and false detection, that the\nproprioceptive sensor (IMU) data are usually engaged to compensate. Recently\nego-motion constraint obtained by Inertial measurement unit (IMU)\npreintegration has been extensively used in simultaneous localization and\nmapping (SLAM) to alleviate the computation burden. This paper introduces an\nextended preintegration incorporating the IMU preintegration of two platforms\nto formulate the motion constraint of relative state. One merit of this\nanalytic constraint is that it can be seamlessly integrated into the unified\ngraph optimization framework to implement the relative state estimation in a\nhigh-performance real-time tracking thread, another point is a full smoother\ndesign with this precise constraint to optimize the 3D coordinate and refine\nthe state for the refinement thread. We compare extensively in simulations the\nproposed algorithms with two existing approaches to confirm our outperformance.\nIn the real virtual reality (VR) application design with the proposed\nestimator, we properly realize the visual tracking of the six degrees of\nfreedom (6DoF) controller suitable for almost all scenarios, including the\nchallenging environment with missing features, light mutation, dynamic scenes,\netc. The demo video is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0idb9Ls2iAM.

We\nuse cube-shaped robots that can carry one cubic block at a time, and move\nforward, reverse, left, and right to an adjacent cell of the same height or\nclimb up and down one cube height. To construct structures taller than one\ncube, the robots must build supporting stairs made of blocks and remove the\nstairs once the structure is built. Conventional techniques solve for the\nentire structure at once and quickly become intractable for larger workspaces\nand complex structures, especially in a multi-agent setting. To this end, we\npresent a decomposition algorithm that computes valid substructures based on\nintrinsic structural dependencies. We use Mixed Integer Linear Programming\n(MILP) to solve for each of these substructures and then aggregate the\nsolutions to construct the entire structure. Extensive testing on 200 randomly\ngenerated structures shows an order of magnitude improvement in the solution\ncomputation time compared to an MILP approach without decomposition.\nAdditionally, compared to Reinforcement Learning (RL) based and\nheuristics-based approaches drawn from the literature, our solution indicates\norders of magnitude improvement in the number of pick-up and drop-off actions\nrequired to construct a structure. Furthermore, we leverage the independence\nbetween substructures to detect which sub-structures can be built in parallel.\nWith this parallelization technique, we illustrate a further improvement in the\nnumber of time steps required to complete building the structure.

It remains challenging to achieve\nsafety requirement under state uncertainties for CAVs, considering the noisy\nsensor measurements and the vulnerability of communication channels. In this\nwork, we propose a Robust Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with robust\nSafety Shield (SR-MAPPO) for CAVs in various driving scenarios. Both robust\nMARL algorithm and control barrier function (CBF)-based safety shield are used\nin our approach to cope with the perturbed or uncertain state inputs. The\nrobust policy is trained with a worst-case Q function regularization module\nthat pursues higher lower-bounded reward in the former, whereas the latter,\ni.e., the robust CBF safety shield accounts for CAVs' collision-free\nconstraints in complicated driving scenarios with even perturbed vehicle state\ninformation. We validate the advantages of SR-MAPPO in robustness and safety\nand compare it with baselines under different driving and state perturbation\nscenarios in CARLA simulator.

        "abstract": "  Swarms of aerial drones have recently been considered for last-mile\ndeliveries in urban logistics or automated construction. At the same time,\ncollaborative transportation of payloads by multiple drones is another\nimportant area of recent research. However, efficient coordination algorithms\nfor collaborative transportation of many payloads by many drones remain to be\nconsidered. In this work, we formulate the collaborative transportation of\npayloads by a swarm of drones as a novel, under-capacitated generalization of\nvehicle routing problems (VRP), which may also be of separate interest. In\ncontrast to standard VRP and capacitated VRP, we must additionally consider\nwaiting times for payloads lifted cooperatively by multiple drones, and the\ncorresponding coordination. Algorithmically, we provide a solution encoding\nthat avoids deadlocks and formulate an appropriate alternating minimization\nscheme to solve the problem. On the hardware side, we integrate our algorithms\nwith collision avoidance and drone controllers. The approach and the impact of\nthe system integration are successfully verified empirically, both on a swarm\nof real nano-quadcopters and for large swarms in simulation. Overall, we\nprovide a framework for collaborative transportation with aerial drone swarms,\nthat uses only as many drones as necessary for the transportation of any single\npayload.\n",

This algorithm\nsimultaneously estimates the agents position and orientation and the magnetic\nfield norm in a central unit that can communicate with all agents at all times.\nIn cases where a central unit is not available, and there are communication\ndrop-outs between agents, our second algorithm is a distributed approach that\ncan be employed.\n  We tested both algorithms by estimating the position of magnetometers carried\nby three people in an optical motion capture lab with simulated odometry and\nsimulated communication dropouts between agents. We show that both algorithms\nare able to compensate for drift in a case where single-agent SLAM is not. We\nalso discuss the conditions for the estimate from our distributed algorithm to\nconverge to the estimate from the centralized algorithm, both theoretically and\nexperimentally.\n  Our experiments show that, for a communication drop-out rate of 80 percent,\nour proposed distributed algorithm, on average, provides a more accurate\nposition estimate than single-agent SLAM.

The resulting behavior -\nboth collective actions and individual actions - can be understood intuitively.\nThe approach is entirely decentralized and the communication cost scales by the\nnumber of group options, not agents. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this\napproach using a hypothetical `explore-exploit-migrate' scenario in a two hour\nfield demonstration with eight unmanned surface vessels (USVs). The results\nfrom our preliminary field experiment show the collective behavior is robust\neven with time-varying network topology and agent dropouts.\n",

        "abstract": "  A swarm of robots has advantages over a single robot, since it can explore\nlarger areas much faster and is more robust to single-point failures. Accurate\nrelative positioning is necessary to successfully carry out a collaborative\nmission without collisions. When Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\n(VSLAM) is used to estimate the poses of each robot, inter-agent loop closing\nis widely applied to reduce the relative positioning errors. This technique can\nmitigate errors using the feature points commonly observed by different robots.\nHowever, it requires significant computing and communication capabilities to\ndetect inter-agent loops, and to process the data transmitted by multiple\nagents. In this paper, we propose Collaborative SLAM using Visual Odometry and\nRange measurements (CoVOR-SLAM) to overcome this challenge. In the framework of\nCoVOR-SLAM, robots only need to exchange pose estimates, covariances\n(uncertainty) of the estimates, and range measurements between robots. Since\nCoVOR-SLAM does not require to associate visual features and map points\nobserved by different agents, the computational and communication loads are\nsignificantly reduced. The required range measurements can be obtained using\npilot signals of the communication system, without requiring complex additional\ninfrastructure. We tested CoVOR-SLAM using real images as well as real\nultra-wideband-based ranges obtained with two rovers. In addition, CoVOR-SLAM\nis evaluated with a larger scale multi-agent setup exploiting public image\ndatasets and ranges generated using a realistic simulation. The results show\nthat CoVOR-SLAM can accurately estimate the robots' poses, requiring much less\ncomputational power and communication capabilities than the inter-agent loop\nclosing technique.\n",

        "abstract": "  Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) is a problem that seeks collision-free\ndynamically-feasible trajectories for multiple moving agents in a known\nenvironment while minimizing their travel time. MAMP is closely related to the\nwell-studied Multi-Agent Path-Finding (MAPF) problem. Recently, MAPF methods\nhave achieved great success in finding collision-free paths for a substantial\nnumber of agents. However, those methods often overlook the kinodynamic\nconstraints of the agents, assuming instantaneous movement, which limits their\npracticality and realism. In this paper, we present a three-level MAPF-based\nplanner called PSB to address the challenges posed by MAMP. PSB fully considers\nthe kinodynamic capability of the agents and produces solutions with smooth\nspeed profiles that can be directly executed by the controller. Empirically, we\nevaluate PSB within the domains of traffic intersection coordination for\nautonomous vehicles and obstacle-rich grid map navigation for mobile robots.\nPSB shows up to 49.79% improvements in solution cost compared to existing\nmethods.\n",

Each robot is considered to make\nindependent decisions without any communication capability (silent agent). The\nproposed algorithm is based on parameters local to individual robots. Engaging\nscenarios are studied where the silent robots form communities without the\npreset conditions on the number of communities, community size, goal location\nof each community, and specific members in the community. Our approach allows\nsilent robots to achieve this self-organized swarm behavior using only sensory\ninputs from the environment. The algorithm facilitates the formation of\nmultiple swarm communities at arbitrary locations with unspecified goal\nlocations. We further infer the behavior of swarm synergy to ensure the\nanonymity/untraceability of both robots and communities. The robots intend to\nform a community by sensing the neighbors, creating synergy in a bounded\nenvironment. The time to achieve synergy depends on the environment boundary\nand the onboard sensor's field of view.

However, when\nmultirotors fly in close vertical proximity to each other, the propeller\ndownwash from the vehicles can have a destabilising effect on each other.\nUnfortunately, even in a homogeneous team, an accurate model of downwash forces\nfrom one vehicle is unlikely to be sufficient for predicting aggregate forces\nfrom multiple vehicles in formation.\n  In this work, we model the interaction patterns produced by one or more\nvehicles flying in close proximity to an ego-vehicle. We first present an\nexperimental test rig designed to capture 6-DOF exogenic forces acting on a\nmultirotor frame. We then study and characterize these measured forces as a\nfunction of the relative states of two multirotors flying various patterns in\nits vicinity.\n  Our analysis captures strong non-linearities present in the aggregation of\nthese interactions. Then, by modeling the formation as a graph, we present a\nnovel approach for learning the force aggregation function, and contrast it\nagainst simpler linear models.

ARC creates subproblems centered around\nconflicts, and the solutions represent the robot motions required to resolve\nthese conflicts. The use of subproblems enables an inexpensive hybrid\nexploration of the multi-robot planning space. ARC leverages the hybrid\nexploration by dynamically adjusting the coupling and decoupling of the\nmulti-robot planning space. This allows ARC to adapt the levels of coordination\nefficiently by planning in decoupled spaces, where robots can operate\nindependently, and in coupled spaces where coordination is essential. ARC is\nprobabilistically complete, can be used for any robot, and produces efficient\ncost solutions in reduced planning times. Through extensive evaluation across\nrepresentative scenarios with different robots requiring various levels of\ncoordination, ARC demonstrates its ability to provide simultaneous scalability\nand precise coordination.
